## 📊 Overview  

TUKAcad is a professional-grade CAD system designed specifically for the fashion and apparel industry. It combines precise pattern drafting tools with advanced grading, marker-making, and garment engineering capabilities. Built for designers, pattern makers, and technical developers, TUKAcad streamlines the entire production process by offering digital solutions for tasks traditionally handled manually.

The software provides an extensive set of pattern creation tools that allow users to draft, edit, and manipulate garment components with technical accuracy. Curve shaping, seam allowance management, dart manipulation, and measurement control make it ideal for creating complex silhouettes or detailed construction elements. Whether working with streetwear, luxury garments, or uniforms, TUKAcad supports a wide range of workflows.

One of TUKAcad’s biggest strengths is its grading system, which allows users to generate multi-size pattern sets using standardized or custom measurement charts. This eliminates repetitive manual drafting and ensures consistent fit across size ranges. The intuitive interface makes it easy to preview and refine graded patterns before finalizing them.

TUKAcad also integrates marker-making tools that optimize fabric utilization. By arranging pattern pieces efficiently, users can reduce material waste and ensure cost-effective production layouts. With support for various fabric types, grainlines, and placement rules, markers can be tailored to meet factory-specific requirements.

The platform is used widely in manufacturing and educational environments due to its accuracy, flexibility, and technical reliability. By digitizing the pattern-making workflow, TUKAcad helps fashion teams speed up sampling, reduce production costs, and improve consistency in garment development. From initial design to pre-production, it serves as a comprehensive tool for modern apparel engineering.
